## What is This?
At first, I just want to test the global variable of Python, 
so I use tornado with websocket to do my test,
then I think maybe I can create a chat app taht can be a target to do my test,
finally I finish my test and create a **online web game**....

So it's a online web game based on pathon, tornado and websocket,
I only test for three person, so I don't know what will happen if there are too much people online in the same time,

You can download and play, but I can't promise this is a good game, after all it's just a test.

## Usage
1. Run the **DoNotPlayAtWorking.py**
2. Open browser and go to **localhost:8888/index**
3. Sign up a account
4. then you can play
5. You're friend can also log in, just change web address to  **yourIP**/index
6. Try to log in aleast three person, then you will come into enemy
7. Have fun~!
